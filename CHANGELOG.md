# Changelog

This harness is **built by playing**: nearly every entry below exists because something
bit us in the world first. Each fix records the wound that taught it — the reasoning is
the point, not just the diff. Dates are play-sessions, not releases. Full commit messages
carry more detail (`git log`); deeper war stories live in FIELD-GUIDE.md.

## 2026-07-17/18 — the survival-day session (post-v0.1.0-alpha)

### Added
- **Prospector sense** (ore callout): every 4s, air-exposed ore within 12 announces
  itself as an event, deduped and distance/age-pruned. *Why:* the pilot's `/find` only
  looks when asked; a human player's eyes are always on ("your ore senses need tuning" —
  the helmsman). Fairness preserved: it reuses the exposed-face sense, no wall-vision.
  Its first-ever callout was a diamond the pilot's polling had walked straight past.
- **Durability in `/inventory`**, plus worn armor (slots 5–8) and offhand (45), which
  never appear in `items()`. *Why:* "check armor durability" was previously unanswerable.
- **Sign text in `/blockat`** via `getSignText()`. *Why:* we labeled a chest library
  with signs, then discovered the body could not read its own labels.
- **Exact chest targeting**: `/chest`, `/withdraw`, `/deposit` accept `x,y,z` and
  operate on that chest; nearest-in-12 remains the fallback. *Why:* with four chests in
  one attic, "nearest" silently opened the wrong box and reported it as truth.
- **Outnumbered check** in the combat reflex: 3+ perceptible hostiles within 16 triggers
  a fighting withdrawal instead of engage-nearest. *Why:* death #4 — the reflex dueled
  one skeleton while a creeper and two more mobs converged. The close-in never counted
  the room (the helmsman's diagnosis, verbatim).
- **Drown reflex v1**: oxygen ≤8 while submerged aborts any active dig and swims.
  *Why:* `bot.dig` pins the body in place; the drowning alarm fired eleven times while
  the dig held the pilot underwater to 2 HP. Alarms without actuators are spectators.
- **Tool guard on `digat`**: ore that needs a pick tier refuses to dig unless a
  sufficient pick is verified in-hand. *Why:* the equip inside `equipPickFor` can lose a
  race with the combat reflex silently — a diamond was dug with the **bow** (drop
  destroyed). A refused dig is recoverable; a destroyed drop is not.

### Fixed
- **`/craft` count semantics**: `count` now means items, not recipes, with per-recipe
  yield accounted (planks 4, sticks 4, torches 4). *Why:* "craft 12 planks" once ate 12
  logs and produced 48.
- **Obsidian pick tier**: `neededPickTier` had no case for obsidian/ancient debris, so
  the lowest-sufficient-pick logic chose iron — which breaks obsidian with no drop.
  Cost several blocks of hard-won obsidian before diagnosis.
- **`/eat` accepted only `food=`** while documentation and habit said `name=` — the
  parameter was silently ignored and "best food" chosen instead (the salmon-vs-porkchop
  mystery). Both names now work.
- **Golden apples at full hunger**: mineflayer's `consume()` guard refuses them, but
  vanilla always allows gapples. Now falls back to held right-click. *Why:* the refusal
  blocked the emergency heal seconds before a death.
- **lava_watch spam throttle**: parked beside *static* lava (a dam, a pit wall), the
  reflex re-fired every 4s, each firing killing the pilot's current goal — navigation
  fought its own safety system all afternoon. Now: same cell + hazard no nearer = one
  warning, then 30s standdown. Flowing lava still breaks through because it gets closer.

### Learned (queue, not yet fixed)
- Ore events need **absolute coordinates** — "gold W ~6" is a ghost once the body moves.
- Placement verbs route through the pathfinder, so a boxed-in body cannot free itself by
  placing one block. Escape primitives (place-at-feet, bridge) are the top ask from the
  first solo-exploration tests.
- `/strike` walks to its target — including off a safe ledge into a creeper pit. Ranged
  doctrine from height must be `/shoot`-only until a stay-put strike exists.
- Solo exploration works **with doctrine**: leash from anchor, lit ground only, bow
  only, hard HP retreat line, and out-of-bounds glints get logged, not chased. Test one
  (no doctrine) died in minutes; test three brought home seven diamonds.

## 2026-07-15/16 — spine and stances (pre-release)

- Combat stances + ranged reflex (the bow comes out on its own); eye-ray perception
  tier with honest server range; **no LOS, no loose** (bow requires a clear eye-ray);
  lava_watch body-level veto (death #3: flowing lava entered a path that was air at
  plan time); flee latch (death #1: twelve "disengaging" events, zero escape — re-entry
  kept resetting the flee goal); adaptive disengage tripwire scaled to the last hit
  (death #2: a vindicator hitting 8.6 through iron makes "any hit = leave" correct).
- Manual split: lean DRIVING.md for the pilot's context window, greppable FIELD-GUIDE.md
  for stories. Un-assumed the pilot: any tool-calling model can don the body.

## v0.1.0-alpha — 2026-07-16

First public release: the verb set, the reflex spine, the fairness law (the bot may use
nothing a human player at the keyboard could not perceive), and the journal discipline.
"Built by playing."
